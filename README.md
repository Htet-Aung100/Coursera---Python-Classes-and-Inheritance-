# Coursera---Python-Classes-and-Inheritance 
I completed this intermediate python 3 course prior to starting college. I think this course is a great way to test your proficiency with quintessential concepts in python and bone up your skills alongside. I have attached my solution to the final project of this course and its free of any errors. Would be much appreciated if someone could optimise the code, the exisiting code might go astray at times in its length but does the job!
